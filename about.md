## Nathan Fisher, PhD

I've been a scientist studying infectious disease for over 15 years and I also happen to love stories about zombies, vampires, and werewolves. I combined these two passions in order to create the **Underworld Science** series of fictionalized study guides.

### How they work

Because of their fictionalized content, my study guides engage the creative side of your brain--not just the logical, factual side that most classes and study guides focus on.  Using both sides of your brain to engage scientific content and concepts helps with memorization and recall.
