title: What are Fictionalized Study Guides?
---

On this site, you can become a beta reader for a brand new genre of scholastic writing-_the fictionalized study guide_.

These study guides present **real** scientific terms and concepts through a **fictitious story**. The learning tools most people are familiar with-classroom lectures, text books, and standard study guides-mostly engage the left side of your brain, which is the logical, fact-based side. In contrast, these fictionalized guides engage the creative, story-telling side. Using both sides of your brain to interact with the material [improves long-term memory and recall.](https://blog.bufferapp.com/science-of-storytelling-why-telling-a-story-is-the-most-powerful-way-to-activate-our-brains)  

So while the overarching story line and **underworldly** aspects of these study guides are fictitious, they can help you to master **real biological concepts** and perform well in class or on standardized tests like the AP and SAT subject tests.
